# COMP6411_Python
DESCRIPTION: In this assignment, you will have a chance to gain experience with the Python programming language. Python is an easy to use, dynamically typed Object Oriented language. It is syntactically similar to C-style languages like C++, C# and Java, but is somewhat simpler to understand, at least at the modest level of skill required for this assignment. Your job will be to develop a small database server. Ordinarily, this would be a significant undertaking. However, with Python, this will be surprisingly straightforward and requires a relatively trivial amount of code. Your DB system will work as follows: 1. You will construct a client/server application. In your case, only one client program will access the DB, so you do not have to worry about issues like concurrency or thread control. Itâ€™s just a one-to-one form of communication. Python provides a socketserver class in its standard libraries (and various other network facilities as well). You can use this to get
